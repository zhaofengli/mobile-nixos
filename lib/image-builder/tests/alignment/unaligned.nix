# Through empirical testing, it was found out that the defaults from `sfdisk`

# First of all, on small disks no alignment will be made.
# Starting with 3MiB (empirically derived) alignment will be made.
# The alignment is documented as being based on the I/O limits. It seems like
# for files it ends up causing alignments at the 2MiB boundaries.
# Such, `grain: 1024` has to be set to configure sfdisk for the sane default
# documented in its manpage

# The default is *not* 1MiB and will break the generation of images if it tries
# to align a small partition at the very end of the disk, when the disk is sized
# just right to fit.

# This is what this test validates.
