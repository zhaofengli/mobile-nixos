Subject: [PATCH] HACK: always show logo

It seems showing the logo is not a priority anymore to the linux kernel,
and I can't figure out where in the whole stack it gets set to
FBCON_LOGO_DONTSHOW. I'm thinking it's probably via a do_fbcon_takeover
with (0) (show_logo) that it breaks.

Oh well, it's mainly for my own enjoyment, so for now I'll live with
that. I should probably trace out from where it comes from later on.
