== Device-specific notes

[NOTE]
====
*Do not acquire any Amazon Fire devices with the intent to run Mobile NixOS on
it.*

They are *not* recommended devices. They are not designed to allow the end-user
to run customized operating systems.
====

This works on top of the *amonet* hack, which allows unsigned images to be
booted on some Amazon Fire devices.

=== Flashing

You can either use the flashable ZIP, or manually flash the individual partitions.
With the default partition layout, it's recommended to flash `system.img` to `userdata` otherwise you might not have enough space.
